# seally
display cute seals in your terminal :3


## usage
all you need to do is run the script :)

> [!NOTE]  
> this script uses [libsixel](https://github.com/libsixel/libsixel) to display images in the terminal, head over there for installation instructions
> 
> not all terminals support sixel, you can check out [arewesixelyet](https://www.arewesixelyet.com/) to see if yours does
