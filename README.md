# seally
display cute seals in your terminal :3


## usage
all you need to do is run the script :)

> [!NOTE]  
> this script uses [libsixel](https://github.com/libsixel/libsixel) to display images on terminal, head over there for installation instructions
> 
> not all terminals support sixel. you can check out [arewesixelyet](https://www.arewesixelyet.com/) to see if yours does

## special thanks
https://github.com/sioodmy/blahaj gave me the idea for this
